**This project asks to manage allocations within a memory pool of size MEMSIZE.  The program support six different requests:**

1. Allocate N bytes for a process using one of the 3 allocation algorithms

2. Free all allocations for a given process

3. Show the status of the memory pool – allocated and free blocks

4. Read a script – a sequence of commands from a file, and execute them

5. Compact the allocations, making them into one contiguous block.  (This somewhat resembles the operation of a mark-sweep garbage collector in C#)

6. Exit
