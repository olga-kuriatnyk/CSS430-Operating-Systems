## Unix Shell

This project consists of designing a C program to serve as a shell interface that accepts user commands and then executes each command in a separate process. The implementation  supports input and output redirection, as well as pipes as a form of IPC between a pair of commands. This project will involved using the UNIX fork(), exec(), wait(), dup2(), and pipe() system calls and was completed on any Linux system.
